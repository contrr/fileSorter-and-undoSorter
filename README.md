# fileSorter-and-undoSorter
This JS script moves your files in a specified folder according to the date and file extension.

1. Before you can use this files you have to install nodejs ("https://nodejs.org/en") to use JS on your computer.
2. You have to change the directory in both of the files.

Sort_v.1.js:
const sourceFolder = 'path:'; //You have to change the directory
const targetBaseFolder = 'path:'; //You have to change the directory

undoSort.js:
const targetBaseFolder = 'path:'; //You have to change the directory

3. To use it open cmd and type node /your directory/Sort_v.1.js oder type node and drag and drop the file in you commandline.
4. same for undoSorter.
